= Getting started with The Bug Genie =
{{TOC}}
== Name, slogan and other settings ==
You might want to set the name and slogan, or change some of the other default settings. You can do this from [[TBG:configure_settings|Configure -> Settings]], where you have all the main settings available.

== Your first project ==
The first thing you want to do is set up your project. Although The Bug Genie can be used without any projects, it's mainly an issue tracker, and that's where it excels.

To add a project, log in as an admin, and either click the little configuration icon next to the project list on the frontpage, or click [[TBG:configure_projects|Configure -> projects]]. This will take you to the projects list. To create a project from here, simply enter the project name in the text box and click "Add" or press Enter.

The Bug Genie is now ready to be used for issue reporting with your new project. However, you might want to set up more information about the project. Click the "Edit project" link on the project and change any settings in here. From that page you can also add a project description, release date and more information about your project. This is also where you set up editions, components, releases, milestones, and more.

=== Permissions ===
Your project will initially only be available to the user group that created the project. If you created the project as the administrator user, the project will initially be available only to the "Administrator" group. You can change this by clicking the "more details" link when you create the project. You can also change project permissions for other user groups by going to [[TBG:configure_permissions|Configure -> Permissions]]. Select the "Project specific permissions" tab, and click the project name. From here you can set permissions for all groups and teams in the system. 

To allow easy bug reporting if the global security setting is set to "Restrictive", enable the following permission groups:
* Can access project
* Can access all project pages
* Can create issues, edit basic information on issues reported by the user and close/re-open them

To do this, click the permission group text, and then click the icons for either global access, group-specific- or team-specific access.

''For smaller teams, consider setting the global security setting to "Permissive". This can be done from [[TBG:configure_settings|Configure -> settings]] under the "Users & security" tab.''


=== Project team ===
Someone is usually working on your project. You should add developers working on The Bug Genie to your project. (This of course requires that your developers have user accounts). Click the "Edit project" icon on your project, and then open up the '''Related users''' tab. Add developers, project managers, testers and documentors from this page. By adding developers to projects, you ensure that they get access to project specific features such as project information on their dashboard, issue notifications, and they also appear on the projects' team page.

=== Editions, components & releases ===
==== Releases ====
If your project publishes regular test releases / builds, you should enable releases. This lets you add a specific build / release name / id to an issue so that you can target the issues progress through a set of releases. When this setting is enabled you can also add a release to your issue when you report it, and even make it mandatory during the report process for any given issue type.

==== Components ====
Often a project is made up of several very specific pieces of code or functionality. Such components can be "search", "wiki", "admin interface", etc. and is up to you to decide. Similar to above (releases), an issue can also target a specific component. You can also notify certain developers or teams when a new issue for a certain component has been reported by adding them to the specific component on the project "Related users" configuration page.

==== Editions ====
In some cases your project may also be made up of several different editions. Editions are mainly defined by their included components, and one edition usually includes a different feature set from another edition. You may also want to use editions for version tracking, and set up editions between major versions, such as "MYPROJECT version 1", "MYPROJECT version 2", and so on.

== Reporting issues ==
You can report issues for any projects registered in the bug genie by clicking the "Report an issue" tab in the top menu bar, or the green "Report an issue" button which is shown in the project menu bar. If you're not in any project (such as in the global wiki, your user account settings, dashboard, etc), the report issue form will let you choose a project to report an issue for. Otherwise, the issue will be reported for the currently selected issue.

=== Customizing issue types ===
The Bug Genie comes with a predefined set of issue types available out of the box. These can be customized to show different fields during issue reporting and in the issue overview page. You can do this from [[TBG:configure_issuetypes|Configure -> issue types]], where you can also add new issue types. Keep in mind that The Bug Genie uses the information in these issue types to include them in areas of the system where they would be relevant, such as showing any custom "bug report" issue types in bug report statistics, etc - use this to your advantage!

=== Adding custom fields ===
If the standard issue fields aren't enough for your needs, you can add custom ones from [[TBG:configure_issuefields|Configure -> issue fields]]. These fields are treated just as other issue fields in the system, and are available for searches and issue type customization. There are several types of custom fields to choose from, such as radio buttons, input areas, list of users, secondary status fields, dates, and more.
