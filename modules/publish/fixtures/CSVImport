= Importing data from CSV files =

You can import data to The Bug Genie from a CSV file, pasted into the Import screen. Currently you can only import projects, issues and clients. This document explains how to use the Import feature.

Data must be provided in comma-separated format, with the first row containing column names (which have restrictions - see below). Column values should be enclosed in speech marks if appropriate - The Bug Genie will handle these correctly. In addition, The Bug Genie also performs a number of validation steps to ensure the data is valid, also explained below.

When the tables mention the 'column name', this is what should be in the first row to indicate the column. Some columns are required, some are optional, however if you specify a column in the header row it must be included in every subsequent row. Likewise, you can not specify data in subsequent rows which does not have a matching column marked in the header row.
